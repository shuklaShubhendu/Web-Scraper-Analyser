Here's how I approached the solution:

1 Understanding the Requirements:

I carefully read the provided instructions and requirements to understand what needs to be accomplished.
Identified the key tasks: performing text analysis on extracted articles, calculating various metrics, and populating an output file.

2 Identifying Dependencies:

Recognized the need for Python and specific libraries (pandas and nltk) to handle data manipulation and text processing tasks.


3 Data Preparation:

Reviewed the provided input data (extracted text files, positive/negative word lists, output structure file) to understand their formats and contents.
Prepared the input data accordingly: placed text files in the extracted_text folder, created positive/negative word lists, and ensured the output structure file was available.

4 Code Implementation:

Developed a Python script (analysis.py) to perform the text analysis and calculate the required metrics for each extracted article.
Utilized the pandas library to read input data, manipulate dataframes, and write the output to an Excel file.
Utilized the nltk library for text processing tasks such as tokenization and stopwords removal.
Implemented functions to calculate metrics such as positive/negative scores, polarity score, subjectivity score, average sentence length, etc., as per the provided text analysis document.

5 Testing and Debugging:

Tested the code with sample data to ensure it runs without errors and produces the expected output.
Debugged any issues encountered during testing, ensuring the script handles edge cases and unexpected inputs gracefully.

6 Documentation:

Provided detailed instructions (README) on how to set up the environment, run the script, and interpret the output.
Included comments within the code (analysis.py) to explain its functionality, variable names, and any complex logic.

7 Optimization and Refinement:

Reviewed the code for areas of improvement, such as optimizing performance or enhancing readability.
Refactored the code as needed to make it more modular, efficient, and maintainable.
By following these steps, I aimed to create a solution that meets the requirements effectively, produces accurate results, and is easy to use for end-users.


Output is given in test_analysis_result.xlsx file you can see it but if you waant to run to verify it you can do following steps.

If you want to run the code and get output you can  delete the text_analysis_result.xlsx file ,
you can also delete everything but keep the main.py , input.xlsx , negative_words.txt , positve_words.txt,Output Data Structure.xlsx , keep the extracted_text folder , you can empty it , then first run main.py then analysis.py and result will be in text_analysis_result.xlsx file

Comments are written with the code which will help you to understand the code and what each and ever line does work

1 Dependencies:

Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
Install the required Python libraries using the following commands:

pip install pandas
pip install nltk

2 Python Script:

Save the provided Python script file (analysis.py) in your desired directory.

3 Input Data:

Place the extracted text files in a folder named extracted_text within the same directory as the Python script.
Ensure that each text file is named after its URL ID.

4 Positive and Negative Word Lists:

Ensure that you have two text files named positive_words.txt and negative_words.txt containing positive and negative words, respectively.

5 Running the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the Python script (analysis.py) is saved.
Run the script using the command:

python analysis.py

6 Output:

After the script finishes running, it will generate an Excel file named text_analysis_results.xlsx containing the calculated analysis results.
The Excel file will have columns populated with the computed values for each URL ID.
By following these steps, you should be able to execute the Python script and generate the output file with the required analysis results. 

Any error you can contact me also if some errors are there please don't mind I am very new to all this 
thanks
